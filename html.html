        <meta name="description" content="🚀 Growing the world’s best creators and founders | Founder of Amplify | Make better content in less time with my weekly newsletter · Amplify is the content agency for creators and founders. 

We’ve worked with Ali Abdaal, Sahil Bloom, Jordan Peterson, Chris Williamson, Greg Isenberg, Mikhaila Peterson, PLUS Andreessen Horowitz and Tony Robbins on special projects.

My first job in the creator economy was working for Ali Abdaal for 3 years where, in Noah Kagan’s words, I was the “creator behind the creator.”

Now, we work with the biggest names in the creator economy to grow their influence online and bring that knowledge to entrepreneurs and startups who want to grow a meaningful audience across platforms.

On a personal note, in 2021 I went through a severe period of burnout which was the worst year of my life. I lost my full-time job from the pandemic and put everything into starting Amplify. I flew out the gates building a business around my passion for content creation, but nobody can sprint forever.

The result was damaged relationships, my first run-in with my mental health difficulties and any &amp;#39;progress&amp;#39; I had made in those initial first business quarters was soon washed away. For months I didn&amp;#39;t feel myself, I lost enjoyment in my work, and I couldn&amp;#39;t make progress. I was stuck.

I share this because, as a creator and founder, I know how important it is to have a great team around you and to systematise your content growth so that you can focus on what truly matters. Your content has to be a flywheel that is working for you and it&amp;#39;s essential to have a strategy up-to-date with what&amp;#39;s working TODAY.

If you&amp;#39;ve made it this far, it&amp;#39;s great to meet you. You&amp;#39;re my kind of person and we&amp;#39;ll get along well.

Social media is an incredibly powerful communication tool. We can reach pretty much contact anybody in the world...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI’m going to share how I’ve contacted, and met, some of my favourite people and how you can do the same. Whether you want to say thank you for the value they provide, or you want to pitch to them an idea or a service, it can be achieved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EYOU ARE JUST ONE MESSAGE AWAY\u003C/h2\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the main reasons why I love LinkedIn so much is that we are just one message away from almost any professional in the world. When I first started using the platform, I couldn’t believe you could send a connection request with a personalised note. This is a golden opportunity to get noticed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWindow-openers vs. Door-knockers\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI first heard this concept on the&nbsp;\u003Ca href=\"https://castro.fm/episode/JD5FGu?\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003EMy First Million\u003C/a\u003E&nbsp;podcast. Window-openers vs. door-knockers is a great way to visualise two different mindsets for how we live our lives. We can take the passive approach of waiting for clear-cut opportunities, ‘open windows’, where we can see the outcome. For example, when looking for work, we might only apply for jobs that are advertised.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn contrast, there is the “door knocker” approach. We don’t know what’s on the other side, but we knock on different doors because we are optimistic about reaching a positive outcome. This is being proactive and looking to make things happen. For example, you might consider the dream companies you’d&nbsp;\u003Cem\u003Elove\u003C/em\u003E&nbsp;to work for and get in contact with them directly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHere are two examples from my own experiences:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EMark Wright was the winner of the UK’s television series&nbsp;\u003Cem\u003EThe Apprentice\u003C/em\u003E&nbsp;in 2014. He spoke at my university and in his talk, he mentioned that the only social media channel not run by his team was LinkedIn. I created a LinkedIn profile, messaged him, and was offered a 3-week internship. This was my first taste of marketing.\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EMore recently, I found myself on a group Zoom call with one of my all-time favourite entrepreneurs who runs an 8-figure business. I suggested improvements to his LinkedIn content and now I’m on his radar. I used to listen to his podcast every day driving home from work. Now I have his personal email.\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003EThe best thing about reaching out to people is that you can get into their circles and learn directly from them.

I know I have. I’m pretty sure I’ve asked Richard Branson before if he was busy…\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou have to do the research. Your message must be worth their time to receive a response.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003EIs it better to spend 30 minutes writing the perfect email for a\u003Cem\u003E&nbsp;chance of a reply,\u003C/em\u003E&nbsp;or to spend 5 minutes writing an email that has&nbsp;\u003Cem\u003Eno chance at all?\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you think spending just 5 minutes of your time is worthy of a response? This is really important and I want to hammer this home. Most of the time, the reason you are reaching out to people is because YOU want something. You want them to notice you. You want to sell them something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a great cold email, the person receiving the email should benefit&nbsp;\u003Cem\u003Efar more\u003C/em\u003E&nbsp;than you will from the exchange.

An example of research would be to find out the structure of the company. Who’s the Head of Design? How many people work in their team?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy not connect with a graphic designer already working there? Ask them about their role and what they enjoy most about working at the company.

Combine this with a company’s “Meet the Team” section of their website to find someone.\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EWhen you’ve identified an individual, research them.

Your LinkedIn content themes can, and will, grow over time – so don’t let that hold you back from starting your strategy!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003ETHE IMPORTANCE OF OUTLINING YOUR CONTENT THEMES\u003C/h2\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the most common mistakes made in content creation is to just post about anything that comes to mind. We can feel a pressure to be posting, whether that’s to meet your own personal content objectives or to fulfill the KPIs of your marketing team. Unfortunately, this results in key planning stages being missed out and subsequently leads to content that doesn’t interest your audience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOutlining your LinkedIn content themes helps in 2 ways:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIt provides you with clarity over what to create\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIt provides clarity to your audience over what they can expect to consume\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy knowing what you are going to be talking about, it becomes a lot easier to come up with ideas under these topics for content.

Another benefit of outlining content themes for LinkedIn is that you can start to build your personal brand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour personal brand is what you are known for. It’s what comes to mind when people think of you. We ALL have a personal brand as there are already pre-existing narratives that come to mind when people think about us.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThankfully, your personal brand is something you can begin to take control of, by strategically telling your audience what it is that you do so that it is easily memorable. This is where your content themes come in, as you can create content around certain topics and be known for this. This allows for people to recommend your content to other people and for you to come to mind when your information and expertise are required.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith content themes, we can freeze from overcomplicating matters. We can choose to not plan out our topics of content because we are not sure how they might look in the future. This is thinking far too many steps down the line. Outline your content themes for now, and then you can review them again down the line to improve them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EEXAMPLES OF CONTENT THEMES FOR LINKEDIN\u003C/h2\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I started creating content I had just finished studying Psychology at university. I was gaining marketing experience from a variety of social media marketing roles. My first two main content themes were A) Social Media and B) Psychology. Having only just started my career, I didn’t have the expertise or an existing audience, so I simply started sharing my thoughts and curating content that I found interesting, under those themes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy ‘niche’ became Social Media x Psychology, where if the two topics intertwined, I would bring my thoughts and ideas to the conversation. You don’t need a degree to share content around a topic. Many people enjoy productivity, personal development and psychology with best-selling authors writing about these topics because they are interested in them – not because they have any qualifications to do so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe intersection between Social Media and Psychology naturally became a ‘niche’ for me - this wasn’t pre-planned. By simply brainstorming potential content themes I was able to see links between different topics. I’ve always been interested in how people behave (psychology) online (social media), so this became the slogan for my personal brand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom expanding this thought out further, I began to think about who might be interested in this content. Well, businesses and brands need to know how people behave online so that they can advertise and market to their users. This is how – with great hindsight(!) – I bridged my psychology degree into the field of marketing. Ask yourself the following questions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat topics would I like to create content about?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat content do I enjoy consuming?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat hobbies and interests do I have that I could document?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you start to create content nobody knows about you. Engage with a smaller group of people and become a regular in a tight community. Create content in your niche and then as you build an engaged audience you will naturally expand out into related groups. Taking my own example, I knew that ‘social media strategy’ would be too competitive for me to focus on at the start. I bolted on Psychology to narrow down my focus, that way, I could come to mind when people thought about the interplay of the two themes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EHOW TO CHOOSE YOUR OWN CONTENT THEMES\u003C/h2\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003EAll content falls under 3 main categories: Education, Inspiration and Entertainment\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to sell a product or service, what industry are you in and what content could you make to educate your audience about these products and services? For example, a website designer could provide tips and tricks on how to improve your website, they could offer free website audits and make the benefits of an optimized website clear in several ways. Then, when somebody needs a new website, they’ll think about who they already know in their network. From posting regular content, the web designer will have put themselves front of mind for when the prospect is in a position to buy. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general, you do not need expertise to talk about a topic or to create content around it. It’s mainly imposter syndrome holding us back. If under your content themes you share personal experiences, you document your journey and you talk about what you enjoy. Who can really complain? Nobody. Has somebody ever complained before about your content? The answer is probably no!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBrainstorming potential content themes:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003EWrite down your favourite topics (What you enjoy)\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EWrite down your expertise (Topics you have experience in)\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EWrite down, more generally, things that you could teach people (This can be related to 1+2, or entirely different).\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a rule of thumb, create 80% of your content around your main content themes, with the other 20% of your content testing new topics. The idea here is to have the majority of your content providing value about your main business offerings, allowing room to test and evaluate for future directions that your content could take.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, write down your main content themes and underneath them brainstorm as many content ideas that come to mind. This exercise is to outline the many subsets of your LinkedIn content themes that you could branch into and to really get the creative juices flowing for content ideas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhilst this exercise might seem basic, how many people actually stop and take the time to do this? Action is everything. Take this time upfront to outline your content themes and you’ll thank yourself later. You’ll have so many ideas for content. Reaching your desired quantity of posts will never be a problem again. Once you have nailed the frequency of posting you can then start to solely focus on improving the quality of the information you share.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EThank you for reading!\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really hope this article has been useful for you!

You shouldn’t be in the dark about the effectiveness of the content you produce for your business from LinkedIn content creation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a data-driven strategy, you can use powerful insights to maximize the value you provide to your audience and to fuel the best strategy to reach your KPIs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EWHY YOU SHOULD POST MORE LINKEDIN CONTENT\u003C/h2\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPosting more content on LinkedIn is the best way to get more out of the platform. When we talk about getting more views on LinkedIn, the benefit is to post more content that your audience engages with, resulting in the right people visiting your profile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENew profile visitors can learn more about you, your business and ultimately the products and services you provide. Your content should educate your audience, and on your profile, you should have direct links to your blog and website. This will allow you to successfully use LinkedIn as a platform for generating traffic for your business.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGaining more views on LinkedIn should be of interest to anybody on the platform. The student looking for their first job can get potential employers and recruiters viewing their profile by posting content. Where they could maximize this attention by having their CV available to download on their profile’s ‘Featured Section’.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContent creators should know how much attention their content is receiving so that they can gauge their highest and lowest performing content, and the content their audience enjoys the most and least. Whilst businesses must know how effective their organic LinkedIn content strategy is to be able to increase brand awareness and sales from their content marketing efforts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EWHY COMMENTS ARE THE KEY TO ORGANIC REACH\u003C/h2\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECreating organic content does not directly cost you money. You can generate tens of thousands of views for your company or organization on LinkedIn, for free, as the platform’s organic reach is currently so high.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow much would you pay for your content to be seen by thousands of people every month?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003EOrganic reach can be defined as the number of people who see your content without paid distribution.\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may have heard Gary Vaynerchuck say that LinkedIn is how Facebook was in 2012. He’s not lying. Back in the old days of Facebook, businesses could quite easily see their content go viral, with Facebook the main social media platform used by businesses to see their posts shared by thousands of people. Right now LinkedIn and TikTok have the greatest organic reach, meaning anybody can create content that can go far on the platform.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo how can you maximize the organic reach on LinkedIn? The best way is to understand the platform. When somebody posts a comment on your content, their connections – the people they have in their own network – will see that they have engaged with your content. This is how content can go viral, as comments allow your content to be shown to new audiences, who can also engage with the content, showing it to their audiences, and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can encourage people to comment by:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAsking questions at the end of your content\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAsking people for their opinion on a topic\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EPosting high-quality content that naturally piques people’s interest\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore publishing your LinkedIn updates, take a moment to stop and consider how you could encourage people to leave a comment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EWHY YOU MUST ENGAGE WITH YOUR AUDIENCE TO GROW\u003C/h2\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to achieve success on LinkedIn, you must be a part of the community and engage with other people’s content. For people to be interested in what you post, you should take time to comment on the content in your feed, to create and nurture relationships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngaging with other people is what LinkedIn is all about – creating genuine connections. With LinkedIn currently the best B2B platform, there is a world of opportunity for your business to unravel by taking the time to bring value to the platform.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngaging with other people, sending personalized connection requests and building relationships over direct messaging will take time. But we are talking about building a large, engaged audience for your business which is priceless and definitely ROI positive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003ETHE TYPES OF LINKEDIN CONTENT YOU SHOULD BE POSTING\u003C/h2\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDifferent types of content on LinkedIn receive varying levels of engagement. You should test a variety of content (text, images, videos, carousels) to see what content resonates with your audience the most.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVideo content and carousels may appear to receive fewer views than text content, but they can provide the most value to your audience. Including these posts in your content mix now has increased importance, as LinkedIn’s most recent algorithm change focuses on “dwell time”, which is how long somebody stays on your content for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should post a variety of content to LinkedIn as different types of content have different benefits. Text posts generally receive the most views, which may be explained by how the content is easy to consume and interact with, resulting in more comments. Although, with a new focus on dwell time, video content can keep users on your content for minutes. This is far more valuable for your audience and you can be more confident that your information has been consumed if the video was engaging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003ESIMPLE STRATEGIES TO INCREASE LINKEDIN PROFILE VIEWS\u003C/h2\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can increase how many people visit your profile on LinkedIn in the following ways:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOptimize your LinkedIn headline \u003C/strong\u003E– This is visible across the platform and will encourage profile clicks if it is intriguing to read.\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOptimize your LinkedIn profile photo\u003C/strong\u003E – People see this in the feed and when you engage.

This makes sense as historically LinkedIn is a platform of professionals, used to get jobs and used by recruitment companies. The best time for posting content was before and after work. So typically before 9am and after 5pm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo be really specific, I found around 8.45am to be the best time for me, followed by 5.15pm (UK time) and then lunchtime.

As people are scrolling through their feeds, your goal is to give them a reason to stop and take notice of your content.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOn LinkedIn, only 1-2% of people currently create content\u003C/strong\u003E, but as more people join the platform, there will be increased competition so you need to stand out. A person's time is valuable, so you must give them every reason to pause and consume your posts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003E3) INCLUDE YOUR MAIN MESSAGE EARLY\u003C/h2\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you are creating your content, it's helpful to stop for a second and ask yourself if your message is clear enough. Sometimes we can get so caught up in writing a post, that we forget our audience will be seeing this post for the first time. Imagine you're a stranger reading the content. Does it read clearly?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETaking inspiration from Tim Ferriss, if you had to keep only \u003Cstrong\u003Eone sentence\u003C/strong\u003E of your content, what would it be? Make sure this sentence features early on in the post. You want your best advice, knowledge or suggestions to be consumed from a quick glance. We can't be certain that text at the end of our content is consumed unless we have confidence that the content is of significant value.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor video content, you could take a leaf out of Gary Vaynerchuk's book and include the most engaging snippet of the video at the start in a short preview. This will encourage the viewer to watch the full video for context, which will increase your watch time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003E4) FORMAT YOUR POST TO THE SPACE AVAILABLE\u003C/h2\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width\"\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\"10 ways to optimise linkedin content\" data-media-urn=\"\" data-li-src=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C5612AQFg8O3_UKl7-A/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1591257443986?e=1743033600&amp;v=beta&amp;t=Lv_ZhK1Vdyhc-bM1_riedp-LQceuq1F7vTsGg5M5ZW4\" src=\"//:0\"\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis tip may seem quite small but it's actually very important. Different content looks different in your audience's feed which means you have less space to get your message across. This will also vary depending on the device your content is being consumed on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy implementing Tips 2 and 3, you can maximise the space provided before the 'See More' button. For text content you have five lines of space available but only three lines when posting videos, images and carousel documents.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith video content, you may want to consider having a colour palette for personal branding, so even at a glance, your audience knows it was your post.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003E5) TAG AND MENTION BUSINESSES AND PEOPLE\u003C/h2\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your post features a business or a person, be sure to tag them in the post for collaboration and employee advocacy. This will increase the likelihood that they engage with the content as they will receive a notification. If they comment on your post, the content will be shown to their audience which can lead to more engagement and opportunities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EI would recommend that you use all the features on LinkedIn where relevant.\u003C/strong\u003E This is because other social media platforms, like Instagram, have been vocal about favouring users in the algorithm when they use their latest features.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, when Instagram brought out the ability to create polls in Stories, the algorithm favoured anybody using the poll feature, as by doing so, you're essentially marketing this new feature to your followers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003E6) PROVIDE VALUE TO YOUR AUDIENCE\u003C/h2\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis one is a no brainer! But again, it's really important to stop and actually consider the value you are providing to your audience. A great target with every post is to try and leave the viewer in a better position than they were previously because they've read your content.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the answer can regularly be 'Yes' to this question. You will go very far as a content creator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003E7) USE 3 HASHTAGS\u003C/h2\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width\"\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\"10 ways to optimise linkedin content\" data-media-urn=\"\" data-li-src=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C5612AQGD6S0eoVahmw/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1591257463981?e=1743033600&amp;v=beta&amp;t=QoIFJE6gQeWP7trQfAGeLmJf5uimA37FFAmkjkLle2Y\" src=\"//:0\"\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a complete guide to LinkedIn hashtags which you can read here as an \u003Ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/only-article-you-need-read-linkedin-hashtags-joe-gannon-/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Earticle\u003C/a\u003E or watch my video on \u003Ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/joegannon?sub_confirmation=1\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EYouTube\u003C/a\u003E.

Therefore, you should maximise this opportunity and direct them onto other content that they might also enjoy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou don't want people to fall on your content by chance, you should guide your audience to resources based on what they have already just consumed. Relevancy is important and if you take the time to consider what call-to-action matches the content, it will be far more effective and appreciated by your audience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003E9) PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES IN THE COMMENTS\u003C/h2\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe comment section is the ideal place to extend the content you have created.

We come up with ideas at the weirdest times and I think the pain for most people is realising when an idea can be turned into content.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo let's get into it. Ideas, we all get them. It's scientifically proven that we get ideas when our mind wanders away, this is why some of our best ideas happen when taking a shower, exercising, or just before bed when we are feeling more relaxed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\"Do not take ideas for granted\"\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was gifted a poster which I now have up in my room that says: \"La inspiración no siempre se presenta como evidencio. Una idea no es una certeza ni una garantia\". Thanks to Google, this roughly translates to: \"Inspiration is not always presented as evidence. An idea is not a certainty or a guarantee.\"\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn't understand this quote at first, but it really got me thinking about how inspiration can strike at any point, for any reason, and it's our job to take action on the ideas that excite us for that short-lived moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt actually concerns me to think about all the ideas that I've had and never pursued. I feel better when I remind myself to trust my intuition, and that not every idea is worth attempting, but it does stand incredibly important to review the ideas that we have so we can pursue our greatest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhether you write down ideas on pen and paper, or if you store like to store them digitally, you must review the ideas that you have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003ECapturing your ideas\u003C/h2\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA productivity book that I love, and always recommend, is Getting Things Done by David Allen. It's all about creating next actionable steps for the things that you want to get done. This is great, because when you have an idea, you need to review the idea, and then create the next steps and how to turn that idea into action.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my first tip for you guys is to make sure that you have a process where you can track the ideas that you have. This really can be as simple as using the notes app on your phone, or using something like Evernote, Trello, or as I like to use \u003Ca href=\"https://www.notion.so/?r=0277d987cfd049e38adf7717db62a3b5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003ENotion\u003C/a\u003E. These are all free tools which you can access on apps or on your laptop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhenever an idea comes to mind, you can either use the traditional method of writing it down on pen and paper, but if you have a digital version, you can start to do something with that information. You can create a project plan to make the next steps and how to actually pursue the idea into action. So my first way to have more content ideas for LinkedIn is to make use of the ideas that you already have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003ETurning ideas into LinkedIn content\u003C/h2\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo how do we turn ideas into LinkedIn content? One of the most common phrases we hear is: 'I don't have anything interesting to post\", \"Why would anybody listen to me on LinkedIn?\" \u003Cem\u003EEvery\u003C/em\u003E content creator has felt this way before and the difference between the individuals not posting and the creators showing up every day is simply action.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\"If you're at B, you can help anybody who is still at A\"\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a great quote to remember when self-doubt is creeping in. We all have unique experiences, thoughts and ideas to share with others online. And once you have posted a few times, you will remove the initial fear of putting yourself out there and it won't be long before you don't think twice about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can create content about anything you enjoy. Share what you've come across in the week and offer your thoughts around your industry and expertise. You could start posting as a content curator, where you primarily share interesting resources like articles and websites that may be of interest to your audience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContent curation is a great place to start and you can build on this content by adding your original thoughts on top of this content. This is how you can turn your ideas into content to be visible on LinkedIn as a content creator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, feel free to use me as an accountability buddy. So if you want to get that first post out and you just can't seem to do it, drop me a direct message on LinkedIn and I'll help you to get that first post done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EHow to generate more ideas for LinkedIn content\u003C/h2\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, so you've got this far and you STILL don't believe you have enough content ideas for LinkedIn? \u003Cstrong\u003ETo increase your output (of posts) aim to consume more input throughout the week.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERead more books and articles and listen to podcasts related to your industry. By consuming more content and information from other creators, your favourite influencers and brands, this will naturally help you to have more ideas to increase your output.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know for sure that if I listen to a podcast, chances are I get 10 to 15 content ideas. I personally love listening to podcasts like The Tim Ferriss Show and reading personal development books from the Four Hour Work Week to The War of Art, anything that helps productivity and personal growth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you start content creation you will begin to see ideas for content \u003Cstrong\u003Eeverywhere.\u003C/strong\u003E Record conversations with your team to share what you're working on, share quotes you've come across, or your thoughts on the breaking news in your industry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce in the game, it won't be long before you have a bank of ideas for posts. At this point, you'll need to start categorising your content into 'themes' for your personal brand and business, to ensure every post provides value to your audience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterested in weekly content tips?

You can find the answer to this question by using LinkedIn's search bar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width\"\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\"LinkedIn's search bar\" data-media-urn=\"\" data-li-src=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D12AQGjVtOdh4mhuA/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/0/1587374552976?e=1743033600&amp;v=beta&amp;t=0aQVzCG_gkIeQXDKdjGYj6HZQdE6uwSU2HBZwqCWAWU\" src=\"//:0\"\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHead to the top of your screen and type in the hashtag that you are considering.

As I mentioned earlier in this article, your hashtag strategy on LinkedIn is going to change over time as more and more people create on the platform. This is because more content means higher competition for your content to be seen in hashtag feeds. This is why on Instagram, a saturated social media platform, the best hashtag strategy is to identify niche hashtags relevant to your target audience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinkedIn suggests that we use 3 hashtags and I would always recommend to listen to the rare hints the platform tells us about what they are looking for in content. Admittedly, I do find the advice to use 3 hashtags as slightly counterintuitive, because \u003Cstrong\u003Eif you do use more than 3 hashtags your post still appears for all of the hashtags used.\u003C/strong\u003E However, you want your content to be favoured by the algorithm so that it is shown to more people, and I suspect that LinkedIn recommend 3 hashtags so content looks professional on the platform.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo with 3 hashtags to play with, the best strategy to use right now is a mix of large and small hashtags. You should use two broad hashtags to increase the reach of your content, reserving one hashtag to cover a niche that is relevant to your target audience, or as a personal hashtag for your personal brand or business.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003EWith hashtags you are striking the balance between competition and search volume. Large hashtags have high search volume, meaning they can increase the reach of your posts. But they are also more competitive.

Using the hashtag #socialmediatips can be a sign-post to your audience that you provide valuable content that can educate them about social media. With less competition in the hashtag feed, your content can also last in the feed for longer before other content posted makes it harder to discover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now, LinkedIn is still up and coming as a content platform as it's still mainly used for professional networking, where employers post jobs and job seekers post their CVs. The current behaviour is that people search for the larger and more general hashtags, so if this is where the attention is, it makes sense that this is what we focus on in the majority of our hashtags. This can have the benefit of increased brand awareness and spikes in engagement when our audience discover the content.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo summarise, using both broad and niche hashtags allows us to benefit from both.

Personal hashtags are regularly used on LinkedIn by individuals looking to develop their personal brand. The hashtag may be a phrase or a name that is used to stay in the mind of their audience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can use the LinkedIn search bar to identify words related to your name, what you do or your businesses' slogan. Your personal hashtag should be short, punchy and memorable and it's best to use a hashtag that hasn't been used before so only your content appears for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe absolute key with personal hashtags is that you find a hashtag you can 'own' and that people FOLLOW your tag. \u003Cstrong\u003EIf someone follows your hashtag they will receive a notification when you post content.\u003C/strong\u003E But you must get creative with this!

Then, like many of us, I realised this was happening regularly and I became skeptic about what 'trending' means on LinkedIn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn LinkedIn, when your content trends it means your post is being shown as one of the first posts of a hashtag feed.

At best, trending on LinkedIn usually results in a slight spike in engagement from this exposure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, this is a good thing, but don't get too carried away, as most people's content will trend at some point or another. However, your connections do get a notification from LinkedIn that you trended for a hashtag.

For months I didn't feel myself, I lost enjoyment in my work, and I couldn't make progress. I was stuck.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EI share this because, as a creator and founder, I know how important it is to have a great team around you and to systematise your content growth so that you can focus on what truly matters. Your content has to be a flywheel that is working for you and it's essential to have a strategy up-to-date with what's working TODAY.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIf you've made it this far, it's great to meet you. You're my kind of person and we'll get along well.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ELINKS 🔗\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E✍️ I share everything I know in my weekly newsletter: www.joegannon.xyz/newsletter\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E🤝 Book a 1:1 consultation (limited spaces): https://tidycal.com/joegannon/ama\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E🚀 Work with Amplify: www.amplifycreators.com"},{"@type":"WebPage","reviewedBy":{"@type":"Person","name":"Joe Gannon"},"url":"https://uk.linkedin.com/in/joe-gannon"}]}

          <p>Amplify is the content agency for creators and founders. <br><br>We’ve worked with Ali Abdaal, Sahil Bloom, Jordan Peterson, Chris Williamson, Greg Isenberg, Mikhaila Peterson, PLUS Andreessen Horowitz and Tony Robbins on special projects.<br><br>My first job in the creator economy was working for Ali Abdaal for 3 years where, in Noah Kagan’s words, I was the “creator behind the creator.”<br><br>Now, we work with the biggest names in the creator economy to grow their influence online and bring that knowledge to entrepreneurs and startups who want to grow a meaningful audience across platforms.<br><br>On a personal note, in 2021 I went through a severe period of burnout which was the worst year of my life. I lost my full-time job from the pandemic and put everything into starting Amplify. I flew out the gates building a business around my passion for content creation, but nobody can sprint forever.<br><br>The result was damaged relationships, my first run-in with my mental health difficulties and any 'progress' I had made in those initial first business quarters was soon washed away. For months I didn't feel myself, I lost enjoyment in my work, and I couldn't make progress. I was stuck.<br><br>I share this because, as a creator and founder, I know how important it is to have a great team around you and to systematise your content growth so that you can focus on what truly matters. Your content has to be a flywheel that is working for you and it's essential to have a strategy up-to-date with what's working TODAY.<br><br>If you've made it this far, it's great to meet you. You're my kind of person and we'll get along well.<br><br>LINKS 🔗<br><br>✍️ I share everything I know in my weekly newsletter: www.joegannon.xyz/newsletter<br><br>🤝 Book a 1:1 consultation (limited spaces): https://tidycal.com/joegannon/ama<br><br>🚀 Work with Amplify: www.amplifycreators.com</p>
